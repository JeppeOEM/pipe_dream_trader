has since become a foundational piece of modern computing. 
It's known for its simplicity, flexibility, and robustness. 
At its core, Unix provides a set of principles and tools for 
managing computer resources efficiently.


Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel 
initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It powers a 
wide range of devices, from servers and desktop computers to 
smartphones and embedded systems. Linux distributions combine 
the Linux kernel with additional software to create complete 
operating systems tailored for various use cases.

03. Unix is a multi-tasking OS.
04. Unix is text-based but supports GUI, too.
05. Unix is built on a modular design.
06. nix systems adhere to standards, making them highly portable.
