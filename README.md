## Description

This is my bachelor project in Web Development at KEA, it is a web application that allows you to design and backtest trading strategies on historical data, and to visualize technical indicators on price charts. It combines a FastAPI backend for computation and backtesting with a TypeScript + React frontend for the interactive charts and dashboards.
