## Description

This is my bachelor project in Web Development at KEA, it is a web application that allows you to design, backtest, and to some degree visualize trading strategies based on technical indicators. It combines a FastAPI backend for computation and backtesting with a TypeScript + React frontend for interactive charts and dashboards.

## Features

Lightweight, fast, and scalable
React + TypeScript Frontend
Interactive chart visualizations of strategies and backtest results
Real-time updates as strategy parameters are adjusted
Clean and intuitive UI for exploring trading ideas
Strategy Management
Save, load, and modify strategies from the frontend
Compare multiple strategies side by side
